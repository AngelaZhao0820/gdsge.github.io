   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to GDSGE's documentation! 

GDSGE is a toolbox that solves nonlinear Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models with a global method based on policy iterations
introduced in paper :download:`Cao, Luo, and Nie (2020) <paper/GDSGEv15.pdf>`.
It allows users to define economic models in a compact and intuitive script.
It parses the script, implements the actual computations with high performance in C++, and provides a convenient MATLAB interface to researchers.

The toolbox can be used to solve models in macroeconomics, international finance, asset pricing, etc.

Try running your first example, :ref:`Heaton and Lucas (1996) <HL1996>`, 
by uploading the gmod file :download:`HL1996 <example/HL1996/HL1996.gmod>` to an online compiler server deployed at

[`Windows Server 1 <http://122.112.231.135/>`_] [`Windows Server 2 <http://166.111.98.85:30000/>`_] [`MacOS Server <http://166.111.98.85:20000/>`_]
