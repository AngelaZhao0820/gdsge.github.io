Cao (2020): Continuum vs Finite Agents in Krusell and Smith (1998)
******************************************************************

Our toolbox is designed to solve models with only a finite number of agents, or more precisely, a finite number of agent types. 
However, as noted in `Cao (2020) <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022053119301255>`_, these models are important special cases of fully models with a continuum of agents subject to both idiosyncratic and aggregate shocks such as the one Krusell and Smith (1998).
In particular, when idiosyncratic shocks are perfectly persistent in Krusell-Smith type of models, these models become effectively the finite-agent models that could be solved using our toolbox.
In this example, we solve and compare the aggregate outcomes in this special case of the model in `Krusell and Smith (1998) <https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/250034>`_ to the outcomes in their original model where idiosyncratic shocks are not perfectly persistent.

=========
The Model
=========

There are two representative agents :math:`h\in\left\{ 1,2\right\}` in
the economy of mass :math:`\frac{1}{2}` each. The agents share the same
inter-temporal expected utility

.. math::
    \mathbb{E}_{0}\left[\sum_{t=0}^{\infty}\beta^{t}\log c_{t}^{h}\right].

In each period, the exogenous aggregate state of the economy is a
pair of states :math:`\left(s,i\right)` where :math:`s\in\left\{ b,g\right\}`
and :math:`i\in\left\{ 0,1\right\}`. State :math:`s` determines the aggregate
productivity :math:`A(s)` and aggregate labor supply :math:`L(s)`. The aggregate
production function is Cobb-Douglas:

.. math::
    F(s,K,L) = A(s)K^\alpha L^{1-\alpha}.

State :math:`i` determines which agent is employed. If :math:`i=0` then agent
:math:`1` is unemployed and agent :math:`2` is employed, and vice versa for
:math:`i=1`. This approximation of a fully idiosyncratic income process using a
two agent income process is similar to the approximation in Heaton
and Lucas (1996). The employed agent has :math:`2(1-\upsilon)L(s)` units of labor and the
unemployed agent has :math:`2\upsilon L(s)` units of labor. :math:`\upsilon`
stands for unemployment transfers by the government and is set at
:math:`7\%`.

The parameters are taken from `Krusell and Smith (1998, Section 2) <https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/250034>`_ 
in particular, the discount rate and the production parameters are:

.. math::
    \beta=0.99\ \ \ \delta=0.025\ \ \ \alpha=0.36.

The aggregate productivity and aggregate labor supply are:

.. math::
    \begin{bmatrix}A(b) & A(g)\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}0.99 & 1.01\end{bmatrix}\ \ \ \text{and}\ \ \ \begin{bmatrix}L(b) & L(g)\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}0.2944 & 0.3140\end{bmatrix},

with the transition matrix :math:`\pi=\left[\pi_{ss'ii'}\right]`, directly
taken from Section 2 in `Krusell and Smith (1998) <https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/250034>`_:

.. math::
    \pi=\begin{bmatrix}0.5250 & 0.3500 & 0.0312 & 0.0938\\0.0389 & 0.8361 & 0.0021 & 0.1229\\0.0938 & 0.0312 & 0.2917 & 0.5833\\0.0091 & 0.1159 & 0.0243 & 0.8507\end{bmatrix}

In this transition matrix, we use the rows and columns :math:`\left\{ 1,2,3,4\right\}` correspond to states :math:`\left\{ \left(b,0\right),\left(b,1\right),\left(g,0\right),\left(g,1\right)\right\}`.

The following figure shows next period aggregate capital,
:math:`K_{t+1}` as a function of current period aggregate capital, :math:`K_t`,
in current state :math:`\left(b,0\right)`, for two different values of :math:`\omega`: :math:`\omega=0` and :math:`\omega=1`. The figure shows that future aggregate
capital depends on not only current aggregate capital but also on
current wealth share :math:`\omega` of agent :math:`1`.

Given the global nonlinear solution for :math:`\varphi_{\infty}`, we can
also simulate forward and carry out a regression exercise as in `Krusell and Smith (1998) <https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/250034>`_.
From :math:`10,000`-period simulation (with the first :math:`1000` periods dropped),
we obtain the following regression results:

.. math::
    \begin{align*}
    \log K'=0.0438+0.9832\log K; &  & R^{2}=0.999223
    \end{align*}
in good times and

.. math::
    \begin{align*}
    \log K'=0.0167+0.9923\log K; &  & R^{2}=0.997372
    \end{align*}
in bad times. These regression results tell us that, in the simulated
paths of the economy, current aggregate capital seems to be a sufficient
state variable to forecast future aggregate capital, which `Krusell and Smith <https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/250034>`_
call an ``approximate aggregation'' property. However, the figure tells us that this property does not hold globally.

As a comparison, we also solve the `Krusell and Smith <https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/250034>`_'s
model, with the exact parameters above, but in which idiosyncratic
shocks are truly idiosyncratic. We obtain the following regression
results:

.. math::
    \begin{align*}
    \log K'=0.0906+0.9631\log K; &  & R^{2}=0.999999
    \end{align*}
in good times

.. math::
    \begin{align*}
    \log K'=0.0807+0.9651\log K; &  & R^{2}=0.999999
    \end{align*}
and in bad times.

The approximate evolution of aggregate capital is not too different
in the two-agent economy compared to the `Krusell and Smith <https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/250034>`_'s
economy. But we observe that the auto-correlation coefficients for
log aggregate capital are lower than those in the two-agent economy.
The :math:`R^{2}` are also slightly higher than in the two-agent economy.

We can also solve the finite-agent version of the model with stochastic discount rates in `Krusell and Smith (1998, Section 3) <https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/250034>`_.
In their model, agents face idiosyncratic shocks
that determine their discount rate. The discount factor can be low
(:math:`\underline{\beta}`) or high (:math:`\bar{\beta}`), where:

.. math::
    \underline{\beta}=0.9858\ \ \ \text{and}\ \ \ \bar{\beta}=0.9930,

The transition from one to the other is determined such that
the average duration for individual :math:`\beta` is :math:`50` years, which
corresponds to agents' lifetime. 

In the two-agent version of the model, we assume that each agent's discount rate follows this stochastic process. But the two agents' discount rates are perfectly negatively correlated.
To simplify the exercise, we assume that the two agents have the same labor productivity, which varies
with the aggregate state :math:`s`. The evolution of the aggregate
state is the same as in the previous example. The other aggregate
state :math:`i` determines the agents' discount rate (:math:`i=0` agent 1
has low discount factor and agent 2 has high discount factor and vice
versa for :math:`i=1`). The evolution of aggregate state :math:`i` is independent
of the evolution of aggregate state :math:`s`.

The following figure shows next period aggregate
capital, :math:`K_{t=1}` as a function of current period aggregate capital,
:math:`K`, in state :math:`\left(b,0\right)`, for two different values of :math:`\omega`:
:math:`\omega=0` and :math:`\omega=1`. The figure shows that future aggregate
capital depends mostly on current aggregate capital and does not vary
visibly with the current wealth share :math:`\omega` of agent 1.

As in the previous example, from :math:`10,000`-period simulation (with
the first :math:`1000` periods dropped), we obtain the following regression
results:

.. math::
    \begin{align*}
    \log K'=0.0916+0.9633\log K; &  & R^{2}=0.999999
    \end{align*}
in good times

.. math::
    \begin{align*}
    \log K'=0.0789+0.9662\log K; &  & R^{2}=0.999999
    \end{align*}
and in bad times. Because future aggregate capital depends mostly
on current aggregate capital, the fitness of the linear regressions
are very high.

As in the previous example, these regression results are comparable
to the ones in `Krusell and Smith <https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/250034>`_'s model in which the
discount rates are truly idiosyncratic:

.. math::
    \begin{align*}
    \log K'=0.0871+0.9662\log K; &  & R^{2}=0.999981
    \end{align*}
in good times and

.. math::
    \begin{align*}
    \log K'=0.0836+0.9670\log K; &  & R^{2}=0.999976
    \end{align*}
in bad times.
