*****************************************************************
Mendoza (2010): Sudden Stops with Asset Price Deflation
*****************************************************************

`Mendoza (2010) <https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.100.5.1941>`_  studies an open economy model with
a borrowing constraint tied to the capital price. A negative shock that lowers the capital price 
tightens the collateral constraint, leading to deleverage and reductions in financing for both investment and working capital, so the effect of the shock gets amplified.
The model generates financial crises with current account reversals resembling those experienced by many emerging economies.
The collateral constraints are occasionally binding in the ergodic set.
The equilibrium policy and state transition functions feature high nonlinearity. The model has two endogenous states, capital and bond, and can be solved
using the toolbox very easily (in 200 lines of gmod code and within a minute on a regular laptop).


Though the model can be directly solved over the natural state space (capital, bond) using the toolbox, practically it is sometimes difficult
to determine the feasible state space over which an equilibrium exists (e.g., in the current context, an economy too much in debt
may not be able to find feasible allocations, rendering the lower bound of bond dependent on the capital stock
and the feasible state space non-square). We demonstrate how such model can be easily solved using state transformation and implicit
state transition functions, without the hassel of determining the feasible exogeneous state space ex-ante.

===============
The Model
===============

There is a single consumption goods. Preference

.. math::

    \mathbb E_{0}
    \sum_{t=0}^{\infty}  \beta^t[ u\left(c_{t}-N\left(L_{t}\right)\right)]

where :math:`\beta` is the discount factor, :math:`c_t` is consumption, :math:`L_t` is labor supply. :math:`u(\cdot)` is the utility function.

Production reads

.. math::

    A_tF(k_t,L_t,v_t),

where :math:`A_t` is productivity which follows an exogenous Markov process. :math:`F` is a constant-return-to-scale production function. :math:`k_t` is capital, :math:`L_t` is labor, and :math:`v_t` is intermediate goods used.

:math:`\phi` fraction of the cost of hiring :math:`L_t` and :math:`v_t` needs to be financed externally, at a (world) gross interest rate :math:`R_t` that follows an exogenous process. The economy can trade a state non-contingent bond :math:`b_{t+1}` (negative denotes borrowing) with the world, but borrowing is subject to the following constraint

.. math::

    q_{t}^{b} b_{t+1}-\phi R_{t}\left(w_{t} L_{t}+p_{t} v_{t}\right) \geq-\kappa q_{t} k_{t+1},

which says that the borrowing plus the finance for working capital cannot exceed the :math:`\kappa` fraction of the value of the next period capital :math:`k_{t+1}`, where :math:`q_t` is the endogenous asset price of the next period capital determined below. It should be clear that the binding collateral constraint affects the financing of working capital and investment.

Investment is subject to convex adjustment cost

.. math::

    i_{t}=k_{t+1} - (1-\delta)k_t+\frac{1}{2} a \frac{(k_{t+1}-k_t)^{2}}{k_t},

where :math:`a` is a parameter determining the level of adjustment cost. The next period capital price is competitively determined as 

.. math::

    q_t=\frac{\partial i_t}{\partial k_{t+1}}=1+a\frac{k_{t+1}-k_t}{k_t}.

We also write down the shadow price of current capital

.. math::

    q_t+d_t \equiv A_tF_1(k_t,L_t,v_t)+\frac{\partial i_t}{\partial k_{t}}=A_tF_1(k_t,L_t,v_t)-  (1-\delta) -a\frac{k_{t+1}-k_t}{k_t}- \frac{a}{2}\frac{(k_{t+1}-k_t)^{2}}{k_t^2} 


The agent in the competitive equilibrium solves

.. math::

    \mathbb E_{0} \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \exp \beta^t[ u\left(c_{t}-N\left(L_{t}\right)\right)]

s.t.

.. math::

    (1+\tau)c_{t}+i_{t}=A_t F\left(k_{t}, L_{t}, v_{t}\right)-p_{t} v_{t}-\phi\left(R_{t}-1\right)\left(w_{t} L_{t}+p_{t} v_{t}\right)-q_{t}^{b} b_{t+1}+b_{t}
    \\
    q_{t}^{b} b_{t+1}-\phi R_{t}\left(w_{t} L_{t}+p_{t} v_{t}\right) \geq-\kappa q_{t} k_{t+1}
    \\
    i_{t}=k_{t+1} - (1-\delta)k_t+\frac{1}{2} a^2 \frac{(k_{t+1}-k_t)^{2}}{k_t}.

taken exogenous processes :math:`A_t,R_t,p_t` and :math:`q_t^b(=1/R_t)`, and endogenous prices :math:`w_t` and :math:`q_t` as given. Denote :math:`\lambda_t` as the multiplier for the budget constraint and :math:`\mu_t` as the multiplier for the collateral constraint, the first order conditions and complementarity slackness conditions read:

.. math::

    & \{b_{t+1}\}:
    -q_t^b\lambda_t+\mu_tq_t^b+\beta \mathbb{E}_t \lambda_{t+1}=0
    \\
    & \{k_{t+1}\}: \beta \mathbb{E}_t \lambda_{t+1}A_{t+1}F_1(k_{t+1},L_{t+1},v_{t+1}) - \beta \mathbb{E}_t\lambda_{t+1} \frac{\partial i_{t+1}}{\partial k_{t+1}} - \lambda_t q_t +\mu_t \kappa q_t=0
    \\
    & \{\mu_t\}: [q_{t}^{b} b_{t+1}-\phi R_{t}\left(w_{t} L_{t}+p_{t} v_{t}\right) +\kappa q_{t} k_{t+1}]{\mu}_t=0
    \\
    & \{L_t\}: A_{t}F_2(k_t,L_t,v_t)=w_t (1+\phi(R_t-1)+\frac{\mu_t}{\lambda_t} \phi R_t); \ w_t=N'(L_{t})(1+\tau) 
    \\
    & \{v_t\}: A_{t}F_3(k_t,L_t,v_t)=p_{t}(1+\phi(R_t-1)+\frac{\mu_t}{\lambda_t} \phi R_t)
    \\
    & \{c_t\}: u'(c_t-N(L_t)) = \lambda_t(1+\tau) 

The exogenous states are :math:`z=(A,R,p)`. The natural endogenous states are :math:`(k,b)`. A recursive equilibrium  is functions :math:`b'(z,k,b), k',\mu,L,v,c,\lambda,q,w` that satisfy the above equations. The system can be further simplified. Before doing so, we introduce the state transformation to ensure the feasible state space is a square.

==========================
State Space Transformation
==========================
If the economy is too much in debt, it may never be able to finance positive consumption subject to the current collateral constraint, and the equilibrium does not exist. Therefore, the lower bound of bond of the state space depends on the exogenous shocks and capital, rendering the feasible state space non-square. This non-square state space cannot be determined ex-ante either, since the collateral constraint depends on endogenous capital price. This is the well-known challenge encountered by many researchers studying models with a borrowing constraint tied to an asset price. The challenge can be solved by noticing the  boundary condition of the initial problem: the boundary of the feasible state space is such that the consumption (here, the GHH after labor consumption) is zero. Therefore, if we transform the state space to consumption and capital, then the feasible state space will be square.

Define the GHH after-labor consumption as

.. math::

    \tilde{c}_t \equiv c_t-N(L_t).

With the state transformation, we write down the minimum recursive system. A recursive equilibrium is functions :math:`k'(z,\tilde{c},k)`,
:math:`b'(z,\tilde{c},k)`, :math:`L(z,\tilde{c},k)`, :math:`v(z,\tilde{c},k)`,
:math:`\mu(z,\tilde{c},k)`, :math:`\tilde{c}'(z';z,\tilde{c},k)` such that (omitting the dependence on :math:`(z,\tilde{c},k)` when there is no confusion for shortening notations)

.. math::

    & -q^b\lambda+\mu q^b+\beta \mathbb{E} [\lambda'(z',\tilde{c}'(z'),k')|z]=0
    \\
    & \beta \mathbb{E}[ \lambda'(z',\tilde{c}'(z'),k')\{d'(z',\tilde{c}'(z'),k')+q'(z',\tilde{c}'(z'),k')\}|z ]- \lambda q +\mu \kappa q=0
    \\
    & AF_2(k,L,v)=w (1+\phi(R-1)+\frac{\mu}{\lambda} \phi R)
    \\
    & AF_3(k,L,v)=p(1+\phi(R-1)+\frac{\mu}{\lambda} \phi R)
    \\
    & (1+\tau)\tilde{c}'(z')=B'(z',\tilde{c}'(z'),k') +b', \forall z'

where :math:`\lambda,w,q,\lambda'(z')` are intermediate variables and can be evaluated according to

.. math::

    & \lambda = u'(\tilde{c})
    \\
    & w= N'(L)
    \\
    & q=1+a\frac{k'-k}{k}
    \\
    & \lambda'(z')= u'(\tilde{c}'(z'))

The last equation :math:`(1+\tau)\tilde{c}'(z')=B'(z',\tilde{c}'(z'),k')  +  b'` specifies the consistency equation for :math:`\tilde{c}_{t+1}`, which is simply the period-:math:`(t+1)` budget constraint:

.. math::

    & (1+\tau)\underbrace{[c_{t+1}-N(L_{t+1})]}_{\tilde{c}_{t+1}}\\
    &=\underbrace{A_{t+1} F\left(k_{t+1}, L_{t+1}, v_{t+1}\right)-p_{t+1} v_{t+1}-\phi\left(R_{t+1}-1\right)\left(w_{t+1} L_{t+1}+p_{t+1} v_{t+1}\right)-q_{t+1}^{b} b_{t+2}-i_{t+1}-(1+\tau)N(L_{t+1})}_{B_t}+b_{t}.

Notice, how the the budget constraint is taken off by :math:`(1+\tau)N(L_{t+1})` so that this becomes a consistency equation for :math:`\tilde{c}_{t+1}`.


========================
The Mod File
========================

We use the exact specifications and parameterization as in Mendoza (2010). In particular, for preference

.. math::

    u(c) = \frac{c^{1-\sigma}}{1-\sigma}

.. math::

    N(L) = L^{\omega}/\omega

And production function is Cobb-Douglas:

.. math::

    F(k,L,v) = k^{\gamma}L^{\alpha}v^{\eta}
    

For parameters, see the gmod file solving the model :download:`mendoza2010 <mendoza2010.gmod>` listed below

.. literalinclude:: mendoza2010.gmod
    :linenos:
    :language: GDSGE

Most of the gmod codes are straightforward and should be self-explanatory. We do want to highlight that the state transformation and implicit state transition 
are implemented by including :math:`\tilde{c}'(z')` as unknowns in Line 97

.. literalinclude:: mendoza2010.gmod
    :lines: 97-97
    :lineno-start: 97
    :language: GDSGE

defining the consistency equations in Line 136

.. literalinclude:: mendoza2010.gmod
    :lines: 136-136
    :lineno-start: 136
    :language: GDSGE

and including them in the system of equations in Line 156

.. literalinclude:: mendoza2010.gmod
    :lines: 156-156
    :lineno-start: 156
    :language: GDSGE

We also discuss some tricks when solving the system of equations with potentially non-box constraint
(i.e., the collateral constraint which specifies the borrowing cannot exceed a fraction of the value of capital that depends on endogenous capital price).
This should be familiar to you if you already came from the :ref:`Bianchi (2011) <Bianchi2011>` or :ref:`Heaton and Lucas (1996) <HL1996>` examples.
This is done by defining a variable and including it as unknown

.. math::
    
    nb_{t+1}=q_{t}^{b} b_{t+1}-\phi R_{t}\left(w_{t} L_{t}+p_{t} v_{t}\right) +\kappa q_{t} k_{t+1}

so the collateral constraint becomes :math:`nb_{t+1} \geq 0`. And transform :math:`nb_{t+1}` to :math:`b_{t+1}` in Line

.. literalinclude:: mendoza2010.gmod
    :lines: 125-125
    :lineno-start: 125
    :language: GDSGE

Another trick to ensure numerical stability is to normalize each of the equations in the system so they take value in similar scales
(the equation solver handles this automatically to some extent but researchers can do better with prior information).
For example, the Euler equation for bond is written as 

.. math::

    -1 +\mu_t / \lambda_t +\beta \mathbb{E}_t \lambda_{t+1} / (\lambda_t q_t^b) = 0

so the equation takes value between [0,1]. Accordingly, we have defined the multiplier for collateral constraint to be normalized by the marginal utility 
:math:`\hat{\mu}_t=\mu_t/\lambda_t` (:math:`\mu` in the code actually corresponds to 
:math:`\hat{\mu}`), so from the bond Euler equation we know :math:`\hat{\mu}` must lie in [0,1], which is specified as a bound for :math:`\mu` for the equation solver.
These procedures are not necessary but are simple but effective ways to make solving the system more accurately and faster.


Now let's run the policy iterations by calling *iter_mendoza2010.m* returned from a local or remote GDSGE compiler, which produces output

.. code-block:: MATLAB

    >> IterRslt = iter_mendoza2010;
    Iter:10, Metric:0.00819545, maxF:3.83276e-09
    Elapsed time is 5.885684 seconds.

    ...

    Iter:117, Metric:9.38205e-07, maxF:1.53505e-09
    Elapsed time is 1.252342 seconds.

Notice relatively crude grid is specified in the gmod file. We can refine the solution on finer grids starting from a previously converged solutions, by simply
specifying the result as a *WarmUp*. Here we enlarge the state space to be 80 points along both :math:`\tilde{c}` and :math:`k` space, increasing the number of exogenous states
to :math:`8\times 80\times 80 = 51200`.

.. code-block:: MATLAB

    >> options = struct;
    cTilde_pts_fine = 80;
    options.cTilde = linspace(IterRslt.var_state.cTilde(1),IterRslt.var_state.cTilde(end),...
        cTilde_pts_fine);
    k_pts_fine = 80;
    options.k = linspace(IterRslt.var_state.k(1),IterRslt.var_state.k(end),k_pts_fine);
    options.WarmUp = IterRslt;
    IterRslt = iter_mendoza2010(options);
    
    Iter:120, Metric:0.0018683, maxF:8.3636e-09
    Elapsed time is 6.149458 seconds.
    Iter:130, Metric:6.52679e-05, maxF:8.48362e-09
    Elapsed time is 16.472054 seconds.
    Iter:140, Metric:1.57918e-05, maxF:8.50322e-09
    Elapsed time is 13.596291 seconds.
    Iter:150, Metric:4.02934e-06, maxF:8.41073e-09
    Elapsed time is 12.792310 seconds.
    Iter:160, Metric:1.08769e-06, maxF:7.73757e-09
    Elapsed time is 11.707143 seconds.
    Iter:161, Metric:9.56593e-07, maxF:7.234e-09
    Elapsed time is 1.134286 seconds.

The refined iterations continue to converge in another minute. It's always a good convention to start with some cruder grid to assess the properties 
(such as the range of the ergodic set)
of the solution of a model,
and refine it using the crude solution as WarmUps.

Now we inspect the policy functions. The first we do is to come back to our motivation for state transformation: the natural state space
:math:`(k,b)` is non-square. This can be verified by projecting the state variable :math:`\tilde{c}` on policy :math:`b` and state variable :math:`k`.

.. code-block:: MATLAB

    >> figure;
    [cTilde_mesh,k_mesh] = ndgrid(IterRslt.var_state.cTilde,IterRslt.var_state.k);
    surf(squeeze(IterRslt.var_aux.b(1,:,:)),k_mesh,cTilde_mesh);
    xlabel('b');
    ylabel('k');
    title('Feasible Region of Shock Index 1');
    view(-0.06,90);

.. image:: figures/policy_cTilde_feasible.png
    :scale: 60 %

As shown, the level of bond that gives a same lower bound of consumption (here :math:`\tilde{c}` equal to 100) is declining in capital, suggesting that a higher capital allows
the current debt to be higher. However, determining this lower bound of bond level is difficult; but determining the boundary condition for consumption is much easier
(:math:`\tilde{c}=0`). 

We can inspect the policy functions by projecting them to the natural state space as well. For example, the capital price:

.. code-block:: MATLAB

    >> figure;
    [cTilde_mesh,k_mesh] = ndgrid(IterRslt.var_state.cTilde,IterRslt.var_state.k);
    surf(squeeze(IterRslt.var_aux.b(1,:,:)),k_mesh,squeeze(IterRslt.var_aux.q(1,:,:)));
    xlabel('b');
    ylabel('k');
    title('Capital Price, Shock Index 1');

.. image:: figures/policy_q.png
    :scale: 60 %

And the multiplier (normalized by marginal utility) for collateral constraint:

.. code-block:: MATLAB

    >> figure;
    [cTilde_mesh,k_mesh] = ndgrid(IterRslt.var_state.cTilde,IterRslt.var_state.k);
    surf(squeeze(IterRslt.var_aux.b(1,:,:)),k_mesh,squeeze(IterRslt.var_aux.q(1,:,:)));
    xlabel('b');
    ylabel('k');
    title('Capital Price, Shock Index 1');

.. image:: figures/policy_mu.png
    :scale: 60 %

These two policies show that the collateral constraints bind when bond is lower given the capital level.
And the capital price falls more rapidly when the collateral constraint binds.

With the converged policy and state transition functions, we can simulate the economy forward.
To remind readers, we directly interpolate the state transition and policy functions to simulate, which is faster 
than resolving the system (the simulation with 
24 paths of 50,000 periods completes in less than 10 seconds on a regular laptop), by specifying in the gmod file

.. literalinclude:: mendoza2010.gmod
    :lines: 22-22
    :lineno-start: 22
    :language: GDSGE

The variables to be recorded in the simulation needs to be explicitly specified in *var_output*

.. literalinclude:: mendoza2010.gmod
    :lines: 107-107
    :lineno-start: 107
    :language: GDSGE

and can then be included in *var_simu*

.. literalinclude:: mendoza2010.gmod
    :lines: 167-167
    :lineno-start: 167
    :language: GDSGE

With implicit state transition functions for :math:`\tilde{c}` solved as part of the policy functions,
the transitions need to be specified in the simulate block

.. literalinclude:: mendoza2010.gmod
    :lines: 168-168
    :lineno-start: 168
    :language: GDSGE

which means that the next period *cTilde* should peek the policy *cTildeNext* at an exogenous sampled shock index.

Calling simulate_mnendoza2010 produces the following


.. code-block:: MATLAB

    >> SimuRslt = simulate_mendoza2010(IterRslt);

We can inspect the histogram of the natural state variable (k,b) by calling in MATLAB:

.. code-block:: MATLAB

    >> figure;
    hist3([SimuRslt.b(:),reshape(SimuRslt.k(:,1:end-1),[],1)],[50,50],'CDataMode','auto','FaceColor','interp');
    view([15,30]);
    xlabel('Bond');
    ylabel('Capital');
    title('Histogram of Capital and Bond');
    print('figures/histogram_b_k.png');

.. image:: figures/histogram_b_k.png
    :scale: 60 %

We are interested in the fraction of time that the economy is in a crisis (i.e., with binding collateral constraint):

.. code-block:: MATLAB

    >> muGreaterThanZero = SimuRslt.mu > 1e-7;
    fractionCrisis = sum(muGreaterThanZero(:)) / numel(muGreaterThanZero(:));
    fprintf('The fraction in crisis: %g\n',fractionCrisis);
    The fraction in crisis: 0.131997


We can calculate the unconditional moments:


.. code-blocK:: MATLAB

    >> statsList = {'mean','std'};
    varList = {'gdp','c','inv','nx_gdp','k','b_gdp','q','lev','v','wkcptl'};
    ratioList = {'nx_gdp','b_gdp','lev'};
    meanStats = struct;
    stdStats = struct;
    corrStats = struct;
    autoCorrStats = struct;
    startPeriod = 1001;
    endPeriod = 50000;
    for i_var = 1:length(varList)
        varName = varList{i_var};
        meanStats.(varName) = mean(reshape(SimuRslt.(varName)(:,startPeriod:endPeriod),[],1));
        if max(strcmp(varName,ratioList))==1
            stdStats.(varName) = std(reshape(SimuRslt.(varName)(:,startPeriod:endPeriod),[],1));
        else
            stdStats.(varName) = std(reshape(SimuRslt.(varName)(:,startPeriod:endPeriod),[],1)) ...
                / meanStats.(varName);
        end
        corrStats.(varName) = corr(reshape(SimuRslt.(varName)(:,startPeriod:endPeriod),[],1), ...
            reshape(SimuRslt.gdp(:,startPeriod:endPeriod),[],1));
        autoCorrStats.(varName) = corr(reshape(SimuRslt.(varName)(1,startPeriod+1:endPeriod),[],1), ...
            reshape(SimuRslt.(varName)(1,startPeriod:endPeriod-1),[],1));
    end

Most statistics are similar to Mendoza (2010) except that (1) Mendoza (2010) uses Stationary Cardinal Utility (SCU) utility function, which produces
less persistent leverage and bond; (2) Mendoza (2010) solves the model by solving a quasi social planner's problem which produces higher leverage and more
negative bond/gdp ratio. These differences are also noted in `Mendoza and Villalvazo (2020) <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1094202520300028>`_. 


=====================
What's Next?
=====================

This example illustrates how to solve a model with two endogenous state variables of which the exogenous feasible state space may be non-square and hard to determine ex-ante.
The crucial step is to find the boundary condition for an endogenous state variable that makes the state space square. In the current problem, the 
feasible bond range is large enough so the model can be solved (even faster) directly over the natural state space---bond and capital. Such transformation 
becomes relevant for more complex problems, and sometimes the boundary condition needs to be solved following a different equilibrium system. The toolbox accommodates this 
by allowing defining a different system of equations for problems at the boundary. See example Cao and Nie (2017).

The policy functions in the current example are highly nonlinear. We learned how to start with a crude grid and refine the solution with finer grids. A more effective approach
is to let the toolbox to automatically adapt grid to increase points in regions that are nonlinear.
The example in :ref:`Bianchi (2011) <Bianchi2011>` shows how to use adaptive grid for an one-dimensional problem.
Now you can easily solve the current model with the adaptive grid by specifying one option in the gmod file, which we leave as homework.

Or you can directly proceed to :ref:`Toolbox API`.
